Big O - Upper bound in time complexity

Big Theta - Mean time 

Big Omega - Lower bound

Algo runtimes can be described in 3 ways (ex using quicksort)
 - best case
    - all elements in array are ===, quicksort should take O(N) time
 - worst case
    - the pivot for quicksort is continuously the largest element, will take O(N^2) 
 - expected case
    - normally quicksort is O(N log N)
